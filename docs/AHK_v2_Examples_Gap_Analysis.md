# AutoHotkey v2 Example Gap Analysis

## Overview
The repository already includes more than 1,000 AutoHotkey v2 examples across array utilities, standard library coverage, and a handful of GitHub-sourced snippets, but several feature areas remain light on training data and would benefit from targeted examples.【F:EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md†L88-L131】【F:EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md†L227-L243】

## Underrepresented Categories
- **Maths (2 examples):** Minimal coverage beyond simple arithmetic leaves gaps for statistical or numeric workflows.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】
- **Sound (5 examples):** Audio control is scarcely represented, limiting models’ ability to script volume/notification tasks.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】
- **Screen/Pixel operations (5 examples):** Screen scraping and pixel automation are nearly absent.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】
- **DateTime (6 examples):** Scheduling, timers, and time zone conversions are under-documented.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】
- **Registry (10 examples):** Only basic Registry usage is present, leaving advanced scenarios uncovered.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】
- **Library/COM usage (24 examples) and GitHub-sourced patterns (6 files):** External API and real-world automation coverage is shallow relative to other categories.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L33-L38】【F:EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md†L62-L115】

## High-Value Example Additions
1. **Numerical and data-processing recipes**
   - Add math utilities: rounding modes, modular arithmetic, random number seeding, simple statistics (mean/median/stddev), and matrix-style array helpers.
   - Include performance notes comparing `For` loops vs. `Map()` transformations for numeric collections.

2. **Screen automation and computer-vision hooks**
   - Expand pixel and image workflows: `PixelSearch` with tolerance, `ImageSearch` with regions, color-delta comparisons, and screen-capture buffers.
   - Pair with GUI automation: locating controls by pixel signature before sending `Click` or `ControlSend` sequences.

3. **Sound and media control**
   - Demonstrate `SoundSetVolume`, `SoundGetName`, system beep customization, and WAV/MP3 playback via `SoundPlay` and `DllCall` to `winmm`.
   - Add alert patterns that combine timers, tray notifications, and short audio cues.

4. **Time and scheduling utilities**
   - Provide cron-style scheduling helpers using `SetTimer` plus date parsing, daylight-savings adjustments, and ISO 8601 formatting.
   - Include stopwatch and countdown timers that showcase OnMessage hooks for clean cancellation.

5. **Registry and installer-style tasks**
   - Add examples for enumerating keys/values, backing up/restoring branches, editing per-user vs. per-machine hives, and detecting permission failures gracefully.
   - Demonstrate registry change listeners with `DllCall("RegNotifyChangeKeyValue")` to drive real-time automation.

6. **UI Automation (UIA) and COM-heavy flows**
   - Pull UIA patterns from repositories like `Descolada/UIA-v2` to cover element discovery, patterns, and robust retry logic.【F:EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md†L206-L211】
   - Expand COM automation for Excel/Outlook/Edge: object lifecycle management, event sinks, and marshaling data between COM objects and native arrays.

7. **Networked automation and web APIs**
   - Extend existing HTTP/Socket examples with OAuth token handling, JSON payload validation, retry/backoff strategies, and streaming downloads.
   - Include practical REST integrations (GitHub, Slack, Teams) to mirror real-world automation targets.

## Prioritization Notes
Filling the small-count categories (Maths, Sound, Screen, DateTime, Registry) first provides the highest marginal coverage gain with relatively few new files. Pulling in UIA and COM workflows from the recommended repositories will diversify real-world automation patterns beyond the current six GitHub-sourced examples.【F:docs/AHK_v2_Examples_Classification_Guide.md†L25-L49】【F:EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md†L62-L115】
