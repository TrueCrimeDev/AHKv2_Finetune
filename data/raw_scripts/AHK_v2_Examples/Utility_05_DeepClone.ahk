/*
 * Key Concepts:
 *
 * 1. Deep vs Shallow Copy:
 *    Shallow: obj2 := obj1  ; Reference copy
 *    Deep: obj2 := DeepClone(obj1)  ; Independent copy
 *
 * 2. Circular Reference Handling:
 *    seen := Map()  ; Track cloned objects
 *    if (seen.Has(obj)) return seen[obj]
 *    Prevents infinite recursion
 *
 * 3. Type Preservation:
 *    Arrays remain arrays
 *    Maps remain maps
 *    Objects remain objects
 *
 * 4. Recursive Cloning:
 *    Clone nested objects deeply
 *    DeepClone(value, seen)
 *    Preserves structure at all levels
 *
 * 5. Use Cases:
 *    ✅ Configuration snapshots
 *    ✅ Undo/redo systems
 *    ✅ State management
 *    ✅ Testing with fixtures
 *
 * 6. Limitations:
 *    ⚠ Doesn't clone functions
 *    ⚠ Doesn't preserve prototypes
 *    ⚠ May be slow for large objects
