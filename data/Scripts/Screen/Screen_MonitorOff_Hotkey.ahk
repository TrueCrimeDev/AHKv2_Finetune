/*
* Key Concepts:
*
* 1. Monitor Power States:
*    -1 = Power on
*    1 = Low power (standby)
*    2 = Power off
*    Like pressing monitor button
*
* 2. WM_SYSCOMMAND:
*    Message: 0x112
*    System command messages
*    SC_MONITORPOWER: 0xF170
*    Sent to desktop window
*
* 3. SendMessage:
*    SendMessage(msg, wParam, lParam, control, winTitle)
*    Synchronous message
*    "Program Manager" = Desktop
*    Immediate effect
*
* 4. Wake Up:
*    Any mouse movement
*    Any keyboard input
*    System events
*    Automatic wake
*
* 5. Use Cases:
*    ✅ Quick privacy (hide screen)
*    ✅ Power saving (long tasks)
*    ✅ Leaving desk briefly
*    ✅ Audio-only tasks
*    ✅ Presentations (dim during breaks)
*
* 6. Hotkey Selection:
*    Ctrl+Esc - Accessible but safe
*    Not used by most apps
*    Easy to remember
*    Hard to press accidentally
*
* 7. Differences from Sleep:
*    Monitor off ≠ System sleep
*    Computer stays active
*    Programs keep running
*    Downloads continue
*
* 8. Multi-Monitor:
*    Turns off all monitors
*    System-wide command
*    Can't control individual displays
*    Hardware dependent
*
* 9. Best Practices:
*    ✅ Confirm before demo
*    ✅ Explain wake-up method
*    ✅ Use safe hotkey
*    ⚠ Don't use for security
*
* 10. Security Note:
*     ⚠ Monitor off ≠ Screen lock
*     ⚠ Computer is still unlocked
*     ⚠ Use Win+L to lock
*     ⚠ This is NOT a security feature
*
* 11. Related Commands:
*     SC_SCREENSAVE: 0xF140 - Start screensaver
*     SC_MONITORPOWER: 0xF170 - Monitor power
*     LockWorkStation() - Lock computer
*     Shutdown command - System power
*
* 12. Enhancements:
*     - Combine with screen lock (Win+L)
*     - Timer-based auto-off
*     - Idle detection
*     - Per-monitor control (advanced)
*     - Profile-based settings
*     - Scheduled on/off times
